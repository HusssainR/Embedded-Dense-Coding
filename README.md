# EDC
Implementation of Embedded Dense Coding using Qiskit and IBM Quantum Computers. 

## 🚀 Overview

**Dense Coding** is a quantum communication technique that allows the transmission of two classical bits using only one qubit—enabled by prior entanglement. This project implements dense coding on an embedded platform, enabling low-level control over quantum-classical interfaces.

The goal is to explore:
- Encoding classical data using entangled states
- Communication between embedded devices and quantum simulators or hardware
- Real-time classical control of quantum protocols
